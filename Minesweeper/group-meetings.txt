Initial Team Meeting: Feb 8, 2019
Members: Adam Soelter, Josh Vandeleuv, Brandon Pramann, Alex King

Purpose: Formal establishment of team members, project language, graphic framework, IDE, 
and other standardizations to make project run smoothly.

Topics Discussed:
	- Decided on using C# as the programming language with a .Net framework
	- Decided to use Trello to organize the workflow of the project
	- Assigned Initial tasks to each person.
		- Adam : Create a class for the initial game sequence. This class should
			 use the initial form to start the game when the file is executed.
			 form 1 should contain fields that allow the user to indicate the 
			 desired number of mines, columns, and row. It should also prevent
			 the user from inputing nonsensical values in for any of the fields.  
		- Alex : Create a class that can be used for the end game sequence. 
		         This should reveal the board showing all mines and appropriately
			 display the correct ending depending on whether the player won or lost
			 the game. The form should also include a retry/play again button and a 
			 quit button on both the end screen forms. The retry button should recall
			 the intro class constructor created by Adams class in order to restart the
			 game and the quit button should close the form.
		- Josh : Create a class that generates a random 2-dimensional array the same dimensions
			 as the current gameboard and randomly populate that array with the specified
			 number of mines stored inside of Adam's initial class. add .bmp icons to be
			 used by the gamemap class to draw the images over the proper tiles.  
		- Brandon: Create a class that generates a form, tracks the users input, and interacts
			 with the other classes to call the appropriate forms and functions at the right time.
			 this class should also reference the bomb array to track whether a player clicks on
			 a bomb or a free space. 
	- setup project management board(Trello), added group members and assigned jobs. 
	- setup and shared gitHub repository.
	- established soft deadline of Feb 13, 2019 to discuss progress.
